> ### Origin of Differentiation terminologies
>
> The following information are just opinions originated by [Math SE][derivative-stackex], [Quora][derivative-quora], and [Wikipedia][derivative-wiki]:
>
> - **Derivative** implies a derived function $f^\prime(x)$ of the original $f(x)$, the final product which is obtained from the *Differentiation* of the same function.
> - **Differentiate** could refers to the the word *'difference'* as **Leibniz** studied finite differences and introduce (infinitesimal) differentials.
> - **Differential** means a mathematical expression using differentials (e.g. $\mathrm{d}y, \mathrm{d}x,\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x}$)

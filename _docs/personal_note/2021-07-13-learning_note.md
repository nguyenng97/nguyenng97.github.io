## SQ4R

A popular technique to read learning material {% cite study_less --file learn_books%}. **SQ4R** stands for:

- S: Survey
- Q: Question
- 4R: Read, Record, Recite, Review

**Survey** Skim through the entire section, chapter. Read section overview, headings, pictures, graphs for a big picture.

**Question** Be skeptical of what you read. Questioning the facts mentioned in book creates a cue to process the information the next time you read. *'Critical thinking skills encourage students to move beyond knowing information and get to the heart of what they really think and believe'* {% cite critic_thinking --file learn_books %}.

**Read, Record, Recite, Review**. The objective is to become more active in learning. Note down what you read. Recite it. Then review the noted content for better material retention.

## Mathematical logic

- **Axiom** {%cite axiom --file learn_books%}: An *axiom*, *postulate* or *assumption* is a statement that is taken to be true, to serve as a premise or starting point for further reasoning and arguments. The word comes from the Greek axíōma (ἀξίωμα) 'that which is thought worthy or fit' or 'that which commends itself as evident.
